## **🍎 ABOUT**

This an application that will take most common image files via their host URLs and use Microsoft Azure's Translator API to return the object's possible designations in English based on an AI confidence of 80% or higher. It will then provide the means to translate these returned results into 109 different languages with a Google Translate API.

## **✅ REQUIREMENTS**
* Install [Git v2.62.2+](https://git-scm.com/downloads/)
* Install [.NET version SDK 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)
* Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* An Azure subscription - [Create One free!](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/cognitive-services/)

## **💻 SETUP**

### Microsoft Azure ###
* Once you have your free [Microsoft Azure Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/cognitive-services/) you will need to [create a computer vision resource](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesComputerVision) to get your API key and endpoint.
* After your Computer Vision Resource is deployed click **Go to Resource.**
* Within the **Resource Managment** subsection within your created resource, select **Keys and Endpoint** to see your resource keys and and endpoint. These will be placed in 'EnvironmentVariables.cs' described below.

### Clone Repository From GitHub ###

* In the command line use the command ```git clone https://github.com/Scott-Ian/WhatsThatThing.Solution``` to pull down the repo.
* Then navigate inside WhatsThatThing.Solution and enter the command ```code .```

### Update Project With API Key and Endpoint ###
* Create an 'EnviornmentVariables.cs' file in 'WhatsThatThing/Models'.
* Copy the following code into the newly created file:
````
namespace WhatsThatThing.Models
{
  public static class EnvironmentVariables
  {
    public static string ComputerVisionKey  = "[YOUR-API-KEY-HERE!]";
    public static string ComputerVisionEndpoint = "[YOUR-ENDPOINT-HERE]";
  }
}
````
* Replace [YOUR-API-KEY-HERE!] and [YOUR-ENDPOINT-HERE] in the code above with your own API-key and endpoint acquired from your Azure account. 

### Build and Run ###
* Navigate inside WhatsThatThing and type ```dotnet build``` in the command line to compile the code.
